Verifying the simulated aerodynamic effects is crucial to ensuring the correctness of the numerical analysis. In order to assess the reliability of the previouisly conducted simulations, a physical measurement of the pressure along the down-scaled wing.

In figure \ref{fig:scalewing} the down-scaled wing can be seen with pressure-taps along the centerpiece.

\section{Experimental Procedure}

Given the nature of the competition, the average cornering speeds are around $\SI{55}{\kilo \meter \per \hour} = \SI{15.28}{\metre\per\second}$, which is where downforce is of most importance. As shown in section \ref{sec:similarflows}, the desired velocity in the wind tunnel for the scale model can be found from equation \ref{eq:windtunnelspeed}

\begin{align*}
  u_\text{m} &= \frac{\SI{0.6}{\metre}}{\SI{0.15}{\metre}} \SI{15.28}{\metre\per\second} = \SI{61.12}{\metre\per\second}
\end{align*}
