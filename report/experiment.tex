Verifying the simulated aerodynamic effects is crucial to ensuring the correctness of the numerical analysis. In order to assess the reliability of the previouisly conducted simulations, a physical measurement of the pressure along the down-scaled wing.

In figure \ref{fig:scalewing} the down-scaled wing can be seen with pressure-taps along the centerpiece.
