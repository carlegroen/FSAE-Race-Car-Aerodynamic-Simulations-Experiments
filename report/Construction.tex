\chapter{Construction}

In order to verify the computational fluid dynamics used, a 1/4 scale wing was constructed. This miniature wing is constructed for performing windtunnel tests, and comparing results with the simulations. If the two are in accordance, the simulated results of the full scale wing can be used with confidence.

\section{Molds}

The molds for the wings were chosen as positive molds, meaning polystyrene molds of the actual wings were cut out and overlaid with resin coated carbon fiber. In order to do this, we devised a hotwire-based specialized tool for the job. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hotwire}, and the name of the job is to do it slowly in order to receive a clean surface.
