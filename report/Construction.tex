\chapter{Construction}

In order to verify the computational fluid dynamics used, a 1/4 scale wing was constructed. This miniature wing is constructed for performing windtunnel tests, and comparing results with the simulations. If the two are in accordance, the simulated results of the full scale wing can be used with confidence.

\section{1/4 Scale Wing}

The small scale rear wing is constructed in 6 pieces. The large wing is dissected into three parts. Two regular wings, and a central part with 15 pressure taps.

Material selection is based on the ease of machinability - a CNC-miller was provided to us, along with ample amounts of aluminium. This scale wing is not to be used in the actual race car, so weight is not a concern.

\section{Molds}

The molds for the wings were chosen as positive molds, meaning polystyrene molds of the actual wings were cut out and overlaid with resin coated carbon fiber. In order to do this, we devised a hotwire-based specialized tool for the job. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hotwire}, and the name of the job is to do it slowly in order to receive a clean surface.
