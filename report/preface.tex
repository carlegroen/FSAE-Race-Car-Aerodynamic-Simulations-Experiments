\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank our supervisors Jens Walther and Robert Mikkelsen, who allowed us to work on a project we hold very dear. The project let us perform incredibly well for a first time racer at the Formula Student competition in Silverstone, and the Vermilion Racing team will hopefully live on many years ahead.

Furthermore, a big thanks to Rasmus from Philips Lighting, for helping us machine the 1/4 scale wing used in the windtunnel tests.
