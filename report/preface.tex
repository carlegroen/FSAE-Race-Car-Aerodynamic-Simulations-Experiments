\chapter*{Acknowledgements}


I would personally like to say thanks to my supervisor Gorm Bruun Andresen for providing me with the most interesting project of all. It has since allowed me to perform on television, for which I am very grateful. I would like to say thanks to Alex Nørgaard for providing assistance in understanding several key elements of the rocket. I would like to thank Rasmus Uta Rønbro for technical assistance. Lastly, I would like to thank Peter Madsen and his assistant Stefan Eisenknappl for assistance in testing the rocket, providing us with hydrogen--peroxide and a place to stay. After a television appearance, Peter also gave us some kind words, which are much appreciated.
