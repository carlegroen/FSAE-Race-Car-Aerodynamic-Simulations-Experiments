\chapter{Introduction}
Drag, lift and side force. Those are the three cornerstones to vehicle aerodynamics, which dictate how a car acts. Inverted wings serves as perfect agents to create negative lift, also known as downforce.

- Initial thought would be to reduce drag in order for the car to move as smoothly as possible. \cite{jkatz}\\
- Downforce increases tires' cornering and acceleration abilities. Higher downforce gives better grip.\\
- Downforce is like having extra weight pressing down on the wheels without the extra weight penalty. The Hannah Montana deal.

\section{Motivation}
- Why are we designing this to begin with

\section{Design Philosophy}
- what are we designing for? low weight, high downforce. drag a bit neglegible due to high power motors.

\section{Design restrictions} %Maybe move to another spot
