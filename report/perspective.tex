\section{Drag Reductive System}

A drag reductive system (DRS) is well-known from Formula 1, and has in the recent years been gaining traction (or lack therof :))) ) in the Formula Student. It is a natural extension to the aerodynamics of the car, as Formula Student has much less restrictions on aerodynamics than Formula 1. Automatically adaptive DRS, that measures the car's relative downforce and the angle of the steering column could give a big edge on straights, as flipping the wing up to reduce drag increases the top speed.
